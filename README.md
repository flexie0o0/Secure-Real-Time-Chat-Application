# Secure Real Time Chat Application using RSA, AES and HMAC
<hr>
<br>
<h3>
  This project aims to create a real time chat application that implements 3 algorithms, Rivest, Shamir and Adleman (RSA), Advanced Ecryption System (AES) and Hash Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC). </h3>
  <br> 
  <p> RSA and AES has been implemented through a concept called Hybrid cryptogtaphy which works to decrypt and encrypt the message.
  <br> Meanwhile HMAC is used to test the integrity of the message.
    <br> This application allows users to send text, image, and audio messages to their contacts in real-time. It includes features like user authentication, contact management, real-time messaging using Socket.IO, and video and voice call support.
